<!-- Notes -->
<!-- 1. React is a library because it can work in a small portion of our app. -->
<!-- 2. Order of files matter a lot. (CDN links [it contains the link of React code written by facebook developers])
3. React works inside the root element. We can change it as per our need.
4. If anything is there inside the root element, it will be replaced when root.render methods executes. Rest HTML element will remain same-->
